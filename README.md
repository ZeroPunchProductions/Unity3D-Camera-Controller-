# Unity3D-Camera-Controller-
A fully functional freefly camera controller. Simply attach it to your main camera in your scene and use WASD to move and SHIFT to accelerate.
This can be useful if you wish to take screenshots or videos of your game without having to constantly re-adjust the scene camera to get that perfect angle. 
It can also be used for scene transitioning or quick scene adding.
